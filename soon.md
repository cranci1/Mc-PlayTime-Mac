# Unsupported

On this page you ill be able to understand why some launchers/clients wont be supported or it will take a bit of time to fully support those.

<table>
<tr>
        <th>Require Time</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>
    
| Client/Launcher | UnSupported |
| ------- | :-------: |
| Feather Client| :white_check_mark: |
| MultiMC   | :white_check_mark: |
| ATLauncher   |  :white_check_mark: |
| Prism Launcher   | :white_check_mark:  |

</td></tr>
</table>

> [!Note]
> Maybe it can happen that one of the launcher/clients become supported.

### Feather Client

Unfurtunatly Feather Client doesn't support mac so there is no way to make it work.

### MultiMC/ATLauncher/Prism Launcher

These laucher all use the same directory that is "instances/{MC-Version}/.minecraft/logs" so it will take a bit to support all of them.

### Modrinth

The normal directory is "~/Library/Application Support/com.modrinth.theseus/profiles/" and then there is the modpack name so it will require a bit of time.
