# Unsupported

On this page you ill be able to understand why some launchers/clients wont be supported or it will take a bit of time to fully support those.

<table>
<tr>
        <th>Require Time</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>
    
| Client/Launcher | UnSupported |
| ------- | :-------: |
| Feather Client| :white_check_mark: |
| ATLauncher   |  :white_check_mark: |
| CourseForge   | :white_check_mark: |

</td></tr>
</table>

> [!Note]
> Maybe it can happen that one of the launcher/clients become supported.

### Feather Client

Unfurtunatly Feather Client doesn't support mac so there is no way to make it work.

### ATLauncher

These laucher all use the same directory that is "instances/Minecraft{The mc version}{if fabic/forge}" so it will take a bit to support it:
es: "/Applications/ATLauncher.app/Contents/java/instances/Minecraft1204withForge/logs"

### CurseForge

I dont understand how it works. (havent even tryed)
