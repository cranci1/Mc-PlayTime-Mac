# Mc-PlayTime-Mac
This is a simple python script made to check all the logs files on some minecraft launchers.
It currently works on:

<table>
<tr><th>Supported Launchers</th><th>Supported Clients</th></tr>
<tr><td>
        
| Launcher  | Supported |
| ------- | :-------: |
| Minecraft Launcher | :white_check_mark: |
| Tlauncher Legacy   | :white_check_mark: |
| Tlauncher   | :x: |
| MultiMC   | :x: |
| ATLauncher   | :x: |
| Prism Launcher   | :x: |
| GDLauncher   | :x: |
| CourseForge   | :x: |
| Modrinth   | :x: |

</td><td>
    
| Client | Supported |
| ------- | :-------: |
| Lunar Client   | :white_check_mark: |
| Badlion Client| :white_check_mark: |
| Feather Client| :x: |
| Labymod | :x: |

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Feather Client may never be supported due to lack of Mac support.</p>


> [!Note]
More Launcher will be working pretty soon!
